## 1. Problem
- Small businesses (salons, restaurants, clinics, service providers, professionals) waste time answering calls/WhatsApp manually for **bookings, inquiries, and service requests**.  
- Existing solutions are either:  
  - Too **complex** (require Meta/Facebook onboarding, technical setup).  
  - Too **generic** (multichannel CRMs not designed for SMB needs).  
- Result: lost leads, missed bookings, overworked staff.



## 2. Solution
- **Frictionless WhatsApp automation platform**: pay → get a WhatsApp Business number → start.  
- Industry-specific **templates**:  
  - Booking flow (Google Calendar sync).  
  - Lead qualification (lawyers, architects, consultants).  
  - Service dispatch (plumbers, cleaners).  
- **Dashboard**: see all conversations + bookings/leads/jobs in one place.  
- **Top support**: onboarding + live help, tuned for non-technical SMB owners.  


## 3. Target Market
- Initial geography: **Spain** (WhatsApp penetration ~90%, but only ~27% SMB adoption).  
- Expansion: **Europe, LATAM, India, Brazil** (similar SMB + WhatsApp-heavy markets).  
- Segments:  
  - Booking-based: salons, clinics, restaurants.  
  - Lead-based: lawyers, architects, consultants.  
  - Dispatch-based: plumbers, electricians, cleaners.  


## 4. Unique Value Proposition
- “Your **24/7 receptionist** on WhatsApp — set up instantly, without tech headaches.”  
- Unlike competitors:  
  - **Not multichannel bloat** (focus only on WhatsApp).  
  - **Instant onboarding** (we provision number + templates for them).  
  - **Vertical templates** (ready-to-use, no flow building needed).  


## 5. Competitors
- **360dialog** – frictionless WABA, but developer-focused, no SMB dashboard.  
- **Tidio / Respond.io** – good UI, but multichannel, not WhatsApp-first, limited SMB flows.  
- **WATI, Callbell, Gupshup** – offer inboxes, but lack easy onboarding + SMB simplicity.  
- **Opportunity**: combine frictionless onboarding + templates + strong UX.


## 6. Business Model
- **Pricing**:  
  - Setup fee: €49–€99 (covers number provisioning, onboarding).  
  - Monthly subscription:  
    - Starter (€29): 100 conv./month, 1 template.  
    - Pro (€59): 500 conv./month, booking + calendar integration.  
    - Premium (€99+): unlimited conv., multiple templates, advanced support.  
- Costs: Meta conversation fees (passed through or included in plan).  
- Upsells: multi-location, integrations (Stripe, CRM), white-label for agencies.  


## 7. Go-to-Market
- **Pilot clients**: personal network (3 salons, 1 restaurant, 1 architect).  
- **Acquisition**:  
  - Direct outreach in Spain SMB verticals.  
  - Local digital agencies → resell under their brand.  
  - WhatsApp Ads (“Click to WhatsApp”) for lead generation.  
- **Expansion**: focus on WhatsApp-heavy markets (Spain → LATAM → EU/India).  


## 8. Product Roadmap (High-level)
- **MVP (3 months):**  
  - Booking flow (Google Calendar).  
  - Dashboard with conversations + bookings.  
  - Frictionless onboarding with number provisioning.  
  - 2–3 prebuilt templates.  
- **6 months:**  
  - Add lead qualification & dispatch flows.  
  - Add reminders + simple analytics.  
  - Agency white-label option.  
- **12 months:**  
  - Multichannel (Instagram DMs, Messenger).  
  - Payments in WhatsApp.  
  - AI assistant for FAQ + smart replies.  


## 9. Risks & Mitigation
- **Onboarding friction (Meta/Facebook requirements)** → Use your-owned WABA for MVP, migrate big clients later.  
- **Compliance (spam, misuse)** → Strict opt-in, monitor quality scores.  
- **Competition from bigger players** → Differentiate with SMB simplicity + support.  


## 10. Next Steps
1. Secure domain (Kalabot.com / Workatron.com).  
2. Build simple website + your own company chatbot demo.  
3. Pilot with 2–4 known SMBs (free → paid validation).  
4. Launch SaaS dashboard MVP (booking first).  
5. Scale outreach through agencies + targeted ads.


## 11. Future (new products when having Whatsapp know-how)
1. Payments
2. Catalog + payments
3. Group subscriptions and paywalls
